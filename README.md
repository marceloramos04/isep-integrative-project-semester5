# Surgical Appointment and Resource Management

## Description

The scope of this project was to develop a prototype system for surgical requests, appointment, and resource management. The system should enable hospitals and clinics to manage surgery appointments, and patient records. It should also offer real-time 3D visualization of resource availability within the facility and optimize scheduling and resource usage.

## Purpose

This project was required by the LAPR5 curricular unit/subject (Laboratory/Project V) in the fifth semester of the Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering at ISEP. The objective of the curricular unit is to integrate the content from the various subjects of that semester and to simulate a real-world collaborative development environment as found in the software industry.

## System Components

- **Main Backend API**: management (CRUD operations) of hospital staff, patients, types of surgeries, surgical rooms, and surgery requests and appointments.
- **Complementary Backend API**: management of patients’ medical history, allergies, and medical conditions.
- **Frontend**: Single-Page Application (SPA) built with Angular, including a 3D visualization module to allow hospital staff to monitor the availability of surgery rooms in real time.

## Technologies/Tools Used

- ASP.NET Core + Entity Framework (Main Backend API)
- Node.js + MongoDB (Complementary Backend API)
- Angular (Frontend SPA)
- REST APIs
- GitHub for version control and project management
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Auth0 for authentication
- Three.js (3D visualization module)
- Bash scripts for distributed deployment across multiple Linux servers
